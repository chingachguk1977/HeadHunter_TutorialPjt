### Description
Allegedly, we received a messed-up dataset from HeadHunter and are supposed to do some EDA/cleanup/visualization here using what we were supposed to learn so far.

### The Problem Being Solved
As the dataset is completely messed up (full of outliers, missed data, unorderly entered data, i.e. simply gotten as-is from the site), it's pretty much impossible to do any analysis. So we're supposed to do a number of preparatory steps to clean the dataset, put together some diagrams, do some EDA and come up with conclusions about various features that are supposedly going to help us with some predictions in the area.

### The Data Lay-out
Download the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PIvuzw-BBIuRcgRcyKUAYCxg5aW4ByNU/view?usp=sharing) and put it in the 'data' folder located in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook itself.

### The Project Stages
The project is complete.

### The Results
Quite entertaining project, a lot of things that were not well learned, popped up right in my face and punched some of my brains out... But eventually it all worked out, so---here we go!
